   <h1>Sudoku tutorial</h1>
   <h2>
      This implementation of Sudoku is not universal, but is very extended. 
      <br>To start playing, press the buttons Easy (easy level), Medium (medium level) and Hard (hard level). 
      <br>To complete Sudoku, press the keys from 1 to 9. 
      <br>If you want to remove the cell, press Backspace or another number key.
      <br>If you are not sure that you can solve this Sudoku, then click on the same buttons, they will generate a new one. 
      <br>The number of errors and assists is shown above, as well as the timer, but only up to 1 hour, 
      <br>because later the game will stop and a new one will start, which you can choose. 
      <br>If you can't solve a Sudoku, then click the Help button to randomly insert the correct answer and solve it based on it. 
      <br>Cells are conveniently highlighted and show errors, so you can solve Sudoku without help.
      <br>When you solve Sudoku, move your computer mouse a little.
      <br><br>Good luck!!!<br><br>
